# Dynamic programming

Dynamic programming solves a problem by combining the solution to subproblems. DP is applied when subproblems overlap i.e. they share subsubproblems.

DP solves a subsubproblem once and store the result in a table, hence there is no need to recompute the answer to subsubproblem eveytime.

## Traits

1. Simple subproblems
2. Subproblem optimizations
3. Subproblem overlapping
